    "Momentum and Value are the most persistent \"anomalies\" in equity investing. But what these mean to an academic is often completely different from how these are applied in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academics call these \"anomalies\" because the standard CAPM/efficient-market model doesn't describe why these effects exists. They show that these effects are persistent by creating a long-short portfolio. For example, a momentum portfolio would be long the universe of stocks with “high” momentum and short the universe with “low” momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the real world, almost all portfolios are long-only. Also, there are constraints in terms of the universe of stocks because of liquidity, size, etc. Market beta plays a smaller role in a long-short momentum portfolio compared to the long-only portfolio. So a real-world long-only momentum portfolio’s return profile will be completely different from that of a long-short academic portfolio."
