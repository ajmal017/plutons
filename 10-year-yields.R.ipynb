    "# 10-year Yields through time\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity investments are supposed to be for the \"long-term.\" Usually, 10-years is where most investors peg their \"long-term\" to be. Investors have a choice between different asset classes - stocks/bonds/gold etc. With government/sovereign bonds, you know the yield (return) you can lock in, risk-free, for a decade today. Since equities are riskier, investors demand higher returns - the equity risk premium - over 10-year sovereign bond yields. This is why tracking the 10-year yield is important for equity investors - it denotes a floor for expected equity returns. Investors would be rational investors in equities only if they felt that it provides adequate excess returns over 10-year bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we plot the 10-year yields of US tresuries, Euro Area AAA rated soverigns and Indian Gsecs."
